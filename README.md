📈 Total Cases and Total Deaths: Through SQL queries, I meticulously tracked the trajectory of COVID-19 cases and deaths across continents. 
The numbers reveal not just statistics but the profound human toll this virus has exacted.

💔 Death Percentage and Infection Percentage: Calculating these metrics shed light on how different regions have been affected differently by the pandemic. 
These percentages underscore disparities in healthcare access and response strategies, urging us to address inequities.

🔍 Infected Count and Vaccination Percentage: By analyzing infection counts alongside vaccination rates, I observed the dynamic interplay between virus transmission and immunization efforts.
These insights are pivotal in shaping effective public health policies.

🌟 Insights and Impact: Beyond numbers, this data-driven approach highlights actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals. 
It emphasizes the critical role of data analytics in guiding informed decisions during global health crises.

This project isn't just about data—it's about leveraging insights to make a meaningful difference. 
Let's continue to harness the power of data to navigate challenges and build a resilient future together.
